# Excel
Those are some of my firsts coding experiments (VBA). Most of my works was done in a professionnal context, and thus can't be shared.
Here are some non confidential files.

1) Import_Export_Universel_Final.xlsm
  Allow for transfert of data from one or more workbooks to one or more other workbooks.
  User settings are stored inside this workbook.
  
2) Jeu_De_La_Vie.xlsm
  The game of life, in excel.
  
3) Mail_auto.xlsm
  Allow for setting a mail template in Excel and send it with a simple click via Outlook.
  
4) Model.xlsem
  Part of a more complexe system of workbooks, wich allow to easily keep track of time spent on differents projects.
  A supervision workbook is used to import or export data, and analyse those data for facturation purposes and activity managment.
  This is the core structure of the user's workbook. Other workbooks are confidentials and can't be shared here.  

5) TestIA.xlsm
  My first AI, created in Excel.
  It is a simple AI designed to guess the color of a flower's petal based of the lenght and width of said petal.
  This is a supervised learning algorithm.
  The weights and the values of the neuronal network are showed for learning pruposes.
  Input : petal length and petal width
  Output : petal color
